# Containerization vs Virtualization

## Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of a computing resource, such as a server, storage device, network, or operating system. It allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine, each with its own operating system and applications. This is achieved through a hypervisor, which manages the VMs and allocates resources from the physical hardware.

Some benefits of virtualization include:
- Virtualization maximizes resource utilization, resulting in cost efficiencies and sustainable usage.
- VMs are platform-independent, and different operating systems can run on the same physical hardware.
- VMs offer greater scalability and flexibility, as they can be easily created, modified, and deleted than physical machines.
- VMs provide strong isolation between applications, enhancing security and stability.

## Containerization
It is defined as virtualization at the operating system level because the isolated user spaces are also called containers. Containers share the same OS kernel but run as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system. This allows for lightweight and efficient application deployment, as containers can be started and stopped quickly and require fewer resources than VMs.
